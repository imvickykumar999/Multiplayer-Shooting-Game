## WAN TCP Game (Python, Ursina, Socket Programming, Playit.gg)

- Designed and developed a real-time multiplayer `first-person` shooter game from scratch using Python and the Ursina engine. 

- Implemented custom socket-based client-server networking with `TCP protocol`, supporting multiple players over `LAN and WAN`. 

- Integrated a public status API using Flask and deployed the server using a branded custom domain `(vicks.imvickykumar999.online)` through DNS + `Playit` tunneling. 

- Engineered real-time player synchronization, health systems, bullet physics, and automatic client discovery via a `custom GUI`. 

- Promoted the project via YouTube, gaining `175+ views` in the `first hour` and demonstrating full-stack game deployment with branding, networking, and online accessibility.
